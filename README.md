# `diveboard-cli`

Diveboard is a macOS configuration tool designed to setup your Mac into a reproducible state and monitor for divergences from that state.
Diveboard can manage:

* Your installed apps, packages, and CLI tools (via `brew`).
* Some macOS configuration (via `defaults`).
* Your dotfiles and other configurations.
* Divergence from state, when your Mac no longer represents your `divefiles` repository, with options to reconcile.
* Manual macOS configuration that cannot be controlled programmatically, by providing suggestions to you.

Diveboard is _configuration-as-code_, and a `divefiles` repository is needed to configure your Mac.


## `divefiles`

A `divefiles` repository is set of configurations bundled together and hosted on GitHub that represent the preferred state of your Mac. 
You can either create one yourself, or request `diveboard-cli` to use someone elses.
An example `divefiles` repository can be found [here](https://github.com/lukeify/divefiles).

Each repository consists of one or more "profiles", each containing one or more "pools".

**Profiles** can be useful to segment your configurations by machine, or by intended useâ€”for example, you may like to have a work profile and a home profile for the different apps you might need on different machines.
You can also introduce profiles that depend on other profiles, to reduce duplication. Commonalities can be confined to this profile, while the depending profiles can contain the unique changes.

## Running

To apply the `divefiles` repository under the given GitHub account name to your Mac:

```shell
diveboard-cli apply --github-account-identifier [github-account-name]
```

This will clone the repository to your machine, and then perform an operation to enable each specified pool.
